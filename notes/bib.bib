    abstract = {It is now over a decade since the pioneering contribution of Gordon (1993), which is commonly regarded as the first instance of modern sequential Monte Carlo ({SMC}) approaches. Initially focussed on applications to tracking and vision, these techniques are now very widespread and have had a significant impact in virtually all areas of signal and image processing concerned with Bayesian dynamical models. This paper is intended to serve both as an introduction to {SMC} algorithms for nonspecialists and as a reference to recent contributions in domains where the techniques are still under significant development, including smoothing, estimation of fixed parameters and use of {SMC} methods beyond the standard filtering contexts.},
